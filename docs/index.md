    title: Anomaly Detection (coming soon)
    details: In the real world, anomalous data is often difficult to identify, and
      even if it can be identified, it requires a very high cost. The anomaly detection
      algorithm collects normal data in a low-cost way, and anything outside normal
      data is considered anomalous.

    title: Computer Vision
    details: Here we provide a number of computer vision algorithms such as object
      detection, image classification, image segmentation and pose estimation.  EdgeLab
      optimizes these computer vision algorithms to achieve good running speed and
      accuracy in low-end devices.

    title: Scenario Specific
    details: EdgeLab provides customized scenarios for specific production environments,
      such as identification of analog instruments, traditional digital meters, and
      audio classification. We will continue to add more algorithms for specified
      scenarios in the future.
